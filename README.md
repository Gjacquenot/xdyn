xdyn is a lightweight ship simulator modelling the dynamic behaviour of a ship a ship at sea, with its actuators, including some non-linear aspects of that behaviour and featuring a customizable maneuvring model.
It simulates the mechanical behaviour of a solid body in a fluid environment by
solving Newton's second law of motion, taking hydrodynamic forces into account.

It was developed by SIREHNA through both self-funded projects and various collaborative projects, including the IRT Jules Verne's ["Bassin Num√©rique"
project](https://www.irt-jules-verne.fr/wp-content/uploads/bassin-numerique.pdf).

**Disclaimer**: This documentation was written for a French project, with
French participants, therefore it is in French. It will be translated
eventually. Also, please note that it is still a work-in-progress and, as such,
can be incomplete. Despite our best efforts, inaccuracies may remain. However,
the documentation will continue to evolve as new developments on xdyn are
on-going.

## Getting Started

The easiest way to run xdyn is to use [Docker](https://www.docker.com/):

~~~~~~~{.bash}
docker run sirehna/xdyn
~~~~~~~

This does not require installing or downloading anything except Docker itself.

Pre-built binaries of xdyn are also available:
- [for Debian 9](https://github.com/sirehna/xdyn/releases/latest/download/xdyn_binary_debian9_amd64.deb)
- [for Windows](https://github.com/sirehna/xdyn/releases/latest/download/xdyn_binary_windows_64.zip)

There are many other ways of using xdyn, all of which are described in [the documentation]().

The **models** implemented inside xdyn are described in detail in [this section]() of the documentation.
You can also learn how to use xdyn using the [tutorials]().

## Building xdyn from source

This section describes what you need to do if you wish to compile xdyn
yourself.
These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your
local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on
how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

To build xdyn, the easiest is to use [Docker](https://www.docker.com/).

Depending on your platform, please refer to:

- [Get Docker CE for CentOS](https://docs.docker.com/install/linux/docker-ce/centos/)
- [Get Docker CE for Debian](https://docs.docker.com/install/linux/docker-ce/debian/)
- [Get Docker CE for Fedora](https://docs.docker.com/install/linux/docker-ce/fedora/)
- [Get Docker CE for Mac](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-mac/install/)
- [Install Docker for Windows](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-windows/install/)

You also need [make](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Make_(software)).

### Installing

Once Docker is installed, use:

~~~~~~~{.bash}
make
~~~~~~~

to build both the Windows & the Debian versions.

If you only want one of the two versions, you can use:

~~~~~~~{.bash}
make debian
~~~~~~~

or

~~~~~~~{.bash}
make windows
~~~~~~~

which performs a cross-compilation for Windows using GCC.

The binaries can then be found in `build_windows` or `build_debian`,
respectively.

If you wish to build only part of the project, use:

~~~~~~~{.bash}
./ninja_windows.sh package
~~~~~~~

for example, to build the Windows package (ZIP file containing the xdyn executable)

or

~~~~~~~{.bash}
./ninja_debian.sh run_all_tests
~~~~~~~

to rebuild the Debian tests.

Once the build has finished, you can run the tests.

## Running the tests

To run the tests for Debian use:

~~~~~~~{.bash}
./run_all_tests_debian.sh
~~~~~~~

To run the Windows tests (using Wine in a Docker container) enter:

~~~~~~~{.bash}
./run_all_tests_windows.sh
~~~~~~~

The tests are written using Google test. These are both end-to-end tests and
unit tests. The end-to-end tests can be a bit long so you can disable them
using Google tests filters:

    ./run_all_tests_debian.sh --gtest_filter=-'*LONG*'

All arguments after the script name are passed to the GTest executable. Please
refer to [the Google Test documentation for details and other available
options](https://github.com/google/googletest/blob/master/googletest/docs/advanced.md#running-a-subset-of-the-tests).
